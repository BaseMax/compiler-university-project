# Compiler University Project

Keep in mind that I am not a computer science or engeering student and do not need to do an academic project.

It's just a fun project to test myself to see how much time I need to implement such a Uni Compiler.

## Tech Stack

Lexer and parser build using **Flex** and **Bison**, other parts are pure **C language**.

For the dynamic strings I use a library called **sds**, it's a cool and tiny library for C.
